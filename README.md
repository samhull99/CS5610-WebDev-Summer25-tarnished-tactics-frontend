# GRADER NOTES
User interface with data by at least 2 CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for at least one database table
- Create, read, update, and delete for builds and guides databases. At least 3 different UI routes (appearing to the user as different pages)
Home page, builds page, build detail page, build creator, guides page, guide detail page, guide creator, my builds page (when signed in)
- At least one Bootstrap UI component not featured in the demo application
Used badge Bootstrap UI component, however I mostly used custom CSS, and added background music.
- Different layout and design from the demo application; it should not look like an obvious clone
Self evident
- 3rd party library for React (not including React DnD, unless its use is completely different from the use in the demo project)
framer-motion animation library for transitioning between pages and hovering over build/guide cards
